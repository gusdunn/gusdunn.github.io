My name is Augustine Dunn (Gus).
I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate in the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut USA.
I specialize in analyzing biological data using computational approaches, especially high-throughput sequencing data including RNA-seq and ddRAD-seq.
This site is still being developed.
