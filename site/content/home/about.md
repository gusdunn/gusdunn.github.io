# Biography

My current Lab studies IBD in children using transcriptomics, deep sequencing, metagenomics, and CyTOF among other methods. I also design and maintain analysis pipelines for the lab.


Previously , I was responsible for overseeing sample collection in the field (Uganda), next generation sequencing management and analysis of population genomics studies.

The project focused on multiple populations of tsetse flies that harbor different versions of the trypanosome parasite that cause human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness).

I use python, R, shell scripting have managed a local Galaxy instance to manage the lab's bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing analysis needs.

In my graduate work, I used bioinformatics to study gene regulation and expression at the transcriptome level in mosquitoes. Specifically, I used RNA-seq and microarray technology to study how bloodfeeding affects gene expression in mosquitoes, and look for over represented patterns in regulatory DNA.

The long term goal of my previous lab is to produce genetically modified mosquitoes that do not transmit Malaria or Dengue Fever that will spread this trait swiftly through local mosquito populations.
