## Greetings

I plan to start blogging through this domain from now on.
Generally, I expect to focus on things that would have helped 'past Gus' from about a month ago.
Things like how I finally managed to solve an annoying python bug or analysis problem.
From time to time, I also want to highlight some of the research projects that I contribute to.

All in all, it remains to be seen exactly how this will shape up.
But I am excited to have a bit of an active online writing presence again.
