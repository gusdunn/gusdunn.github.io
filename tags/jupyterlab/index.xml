      <description>Huzzah! I can not overstate my appreciation to Ian Rose for finally allowing me to switch to JupyterLab as my primary interface to Jupyter Notebooks. I tried before but always returned to the old interface due to the fact that I heavily rely on headings to navigate my notebooks as I develop them. My notebooks are usually pretty long and complex so the lack of a &amp;ldquo;navigation&amp;rdquo; system really impedes my productivity.</description>
